                Over the course of a year, I led a small team of computer science students to create a product 
                for an outside client for our Junior Capstone. We worked with John Pecak to create "The RedLine", a mobile application for 
                both Android and iOS that allows car enthusiast to get connected with their communities and RSVP to car show events 
                and meetups. I was the project lead for my team and worked as a manager, designer, and programmer while also 
                maintaining client communications. Our application supports two users (host or attendees), which is selected when 
                users sign up for an account with our app.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our team used <b>React Native</b> and Firebase's <b>Firestore</b> to build our application. 
                We used <b>Expo Go</b> to simulate our application and demo the app for our client and class. 
                I mainly focused on the frontend implementation and interactive design thinking for our team in terms of programming. 
                I've linked a slideshow below that highlights the main features of our application. These 
                features include: an interactive Google API map, a filtering feature, event creation, and event editing.

                During the first 6 months of this project, we focused preparing the design documentation and improving our 
                technical writing skills. This included creating our vision statement, client charter, user research, user stories, and etc. 
                After finishing our technical documents, we created our initial prototype using <b>Figma</b>, which our client gave feedback 
                and approval to.
                <br>
                <br>
                During the second semester of our project, we implemented our Figma designs for the mobile app. We worked in close 
                relations with our client and met with him on a bi-weekly basis to demonstrate our progress and also receive feedback 
                on the features being implemented. Below is our team's final demo video, which walks through our Sprint 4 user stories and features 
                that we implemented in the 2-week period for our sprint.

                At the end of this year-long project, we demoed our application for a panel of judges in our Junior Design Capstone Expo. 
                Out of over 50 teams demoing, we placed top 3 for best expo presentation for showcasing our product. A picture of our team and the collateral we 
                made for our in-person presentation can be seen below. More about our expo can be read in this article:
