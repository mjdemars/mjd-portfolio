            Over the course of a year, I led a small team of computer science students to create a product 
            for an outside client for our Junior Capstone. We worked with John Pecak to create "The RedLine", a mobile application for 
            both Android and iOS that allows car enthusiast to get connected with their communities and RSVP to car show events 
            and meetups. I was the project lead for my team and worked as a manager, designer, and programmer while also 
            maintaining client communications.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our team used <b>React Native</b> and Firebase's <b>Firestore</b> to build our application. 
            We used <b>Expo Go</b> to simulate our application and demo the app for our client and class. 
            I mainly focused on the frontend implementation and interactive design thinking for our team in terms of programming.

            During the first 6 months of this project, we focused preparing the design documentation and improving our 
            technical writing skills. This included creating our vision statement, client charter, user research, user stories, and etc. 
            After finishing our technical documents, we created our initial prototype using <b>Figma</b>, which our client gave feedback 
            and approval to.
            <br>
            <br>
            During the second semester of our project, we implemented our Figma designs for the mobile app. We worked in close 
            relations with our client and met with him on a bi-weekly basis to demonstrate our progress and also receive feedback 
            on the features being implemented.

            At the end of this year-long project, we demoed our application for a panel of judges in our Junior Design Capstone Expo. 
            Out of over 50 teams demoing, we placed top 3 for best expo presentation for showcasing our product. More about our expo can 
            be read in this article: <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/team-earns-top-cs-capstone-honor-medical-app">Team Earns Top CS Capstone Honor for Medical App</a>
