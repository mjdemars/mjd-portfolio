        During the summer of 2022, I got the opportunity to intern with the UI/UX team at Infinity Ward 
        and help implement designs for the 2022 October release of Modern Warfare 2. I worked on miscellaneous bugs 
        and eventually was able to own my own features on the game. To complete my tasks, I worked in Visual Studio Code 
        coding in <b>Lua</b> and in the studio's proprietary <b>UI editor</b>. I got to see various UI principles in play with my 
        variety of tasks. Due to the nature of the work, I was also able to talk to and collaborate with people from 
        all over the company.
        <br>
        <br>
        Prior to joining the UI/UX team at Infinity Ward, I had never had the chance to work with a team of designers, 
        artists, and engineers on such a large project, and I am beyond grateful for all of the guidance I received. 
        Through this project, I was able to grow as both a programmer and a designer through my tasks and the things 
        I learned from everybody on the team.
