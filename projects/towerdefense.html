        For my class Objects and Design, we were tasked with building a tower defense game 
        from scratch in teams of 4-5 throughout the whole semester. For this project, I was given 
        the roles: designer and project manager. 
        All of our art assets were made by myself using Medibang and Photoshop. I hand drew most of the 
        art assets used and also made short GIFs in Photoshop for our start game screen and end screens.
        I would also implement code on the front-end side to make our game more visually appealing and add all of the text.
        To consider the audio portion of our game, I also composed and recorded all of the music for each game state.  
        In addition to this, I also assumed the role of project manager, making sure that all of the team members 
        were contributing to our final product, and making sure we were on time with all of our deadlines. 
        <br>
        Unfortunately, I am unable to share our game code since it is stored in a private repository, but we 
        made a demo video to showcase our game, which I embeded below.

        Below I have attached some of the backgrounds that I worked on.
        All of the text was placed through code, so these are the backgrounds I designed before that.
