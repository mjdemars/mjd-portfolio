        For my class Media Devices and Architecture, our final project was to build a 
        GBA game from start to finish. All assets in my game (including: backgrounds, sprites, music,
        sounds, etc.) were made by myself. The game itself was coded in C and emulated through mGBA and includes 
        features such as parallax scrolling backgrounds, collision maps, etc.
        In my game, you are tasked with helping a nine-tailed fox to get its fox bead back. You 
        battle evil spirits in battle and have to defeat 3 in order to get to the final boss battle. 
        You also have the chance to stock up on heals to be used in battle by doing minigames 
        scattered through the map. 
        A short play through of my game is linked below to demonstrate some of the features.

        Through this project, I deepened my knowledge of what it takes to make a game from start to finish. 
        Of course, my game is on the small scale since it was independently made within the span of a month, but 
        I was able to improve my skills as a programmer, planner, and artist. One of my personal favorite things about 
        playing games is the sound design, so I had the utmost fun composing and recording all the music/sound effects for 
        my game as well. Below you can find some of the image assets I created, such as the spritesheet and a few backgrounds.
