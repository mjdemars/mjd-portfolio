                In spring 2023, I took a class that focused on user research and designing for human computer interaction. 
                Every design team in the class was tasked with creating a digital product that was focused around the theme of wellness and wellbeing. 
                During the course of this semester, I led a small team of designers to create a high fidelity prototype for a mobile application aimed to helping 
                long-distance couples (or couples with low feelings of connectedness) to increase their emotional intelligence and decrease 
                feelings of disconnection. 
                <br>
                <br>
                My team and I researched our user group in detail, including conducting surveys and in-person interviews, 
                studying secondary research sources, creating our own user personas, drawing up storyboards, and etc. 
                After researching, we created a list of potential products that could address our intended issue and ended up deciding to pursue the idea of 
                designing a couples mood ring that would allow partners to share their emotional states in real time with each other.

                <br>
                We worked in Figma to create our prototypes for the product and tested our app on people who fell into our 
                intended user-group (universtiy students aged 18-24 in long-distance relationships). Below you can find our process book 
                that details all the steps we went through to create our final prototype and solidify our vision for this project.
